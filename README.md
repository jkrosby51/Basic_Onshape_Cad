**Base**
  
  The base is a fairly simple part so it didn't take long to make.
  
**Mount**
  
  The Mount was even simpler, so again it didnt take much time or thought to create this part.
  
**Fork**

  This part required more features and sketches than the other two combined. I already knew how to use all of the features shown in this part, however I had not used
  them in Onshape so I learned where to find new features, including Fillets, Chamfers, Mirrors, and also just creating new sketches off of different faces of the
  part.

**Tire**

  This part was simple but it also introduced the revolve feature as well as the symmetry feature.

**Wheel**
  
  This part took more time to make as it introduced multiple new features as well as utilized features we already learned. While making this part I learned that Onshape   lets you choose parts of sketches when extruding, how to use circular patterns, and changing the viewing style to help efficiency. I also made this in the same part
  studio as the tire and had to make sure they fit together. While working on the wheel I supressed the features and sketches that made the tire so that it wouldn't be
  in the way.
