**Base**
  
  The Base is a very simple part. It helped me get an understanding for some of Onshapes differences from Solidworks.

**Mount**
  
  I didn't learn anything new making this part.

**Fork**

  This part required more features and sketches than the other two combined. I already knew how to use all of the features shown in this part, however I had not used
  them in Onshape so I learned where to find new features, including Fillets, Chamfers, Mirrors, and also just creating new sketches off of different faces of the
  part.

**Tire**

  I didn't learn anything new while making this part.

**Wheel**
  
  This part took more time to make as it introduced multiple new features as well as utilized features we already learned. While making this part I learned that Onshape   lets you choose parts of sketches when extruding.

**Overall*

  So far I like Onshape more than Solidworks because it's online nature is more convenient and some of the other convenience features such as extruding parts of
  sketches.
